# Problem 5
# positive integers. The gcd of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive
# integer that divides the numbers without a remainder.

# One way is recursively, where the greatest common denominator of a and b can be calculated as gcd(a, b) = gcd(b,
# a mod b). Hint: remember the mod symbol is % in Python. Do not import anything.

# For example, the greatest common divisor (gcd) between a = 20 and b = 12 is:
# gcd(20,12) is the same as gcd(12, 20 mod 12)	= gcd(12,8)
# gcd(12,8) is the same as gcd(8, 12 mod 8)	= gcd(8,4)
# gcd(8,4)	is the same as gcd(4, 8 mod 4) = gcd(4,0)
# The gcd is found (and the gcd is equal to a) when we reach 0 for b.
def gcd(int_a, int_b):
    if int_b == 0:
        return int_a
    else:
        return gcd(int_b, int_a % int_b)
